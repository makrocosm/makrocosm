# File metadata

Generate metadata for files.

## Calculate MD5 checksum

Generate the MD5 checksum of a single file.
The checksum can be used to verify the integrity of the file later.

  - Target: `build/${file}.md5`
  - Built dependencies:
    - `build/${file}` - The file that will have its checksum generated.

## Calculate SHA256 checksum

Generate the SHA256 checksum of a single file.
The checksum can be used to verify the integrity of the file later.

  - Target: `build/${file}.sha256`
  - Built dependencies:
    - `build/${file}` - The file that will have its checksum generated.

## Calculate SHA512 checksum

Generate the SHA512 checksum of a single file.
The checksum can be used to verify the integrity of the file later.

  - Target: `build/${file}.sha512`
  - Built dependencies:
    - `build/${file}` - The file that will have its checksum generated.

## Generate bmap metadata

Generate a [bmap](https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool) metadata file
for a raw disk image.
The bmap file can then be used to efficiently copy the raw image to disk
media using `bmaptool copy`.

  - Target: `build/${file}.bmap`
  - Built dependencies:
    - `build/${file}` - The disk image that will have its bmap file generated.

### Example

The following Makefile rule shows how to define a phony target `build`
that generates the bmap file `build/disk.raw.bmap` file for the raw disk
image build artifact `build/disk.raw`.

```make
.PHONY: build
build: build/disk.raw.bmap
```

This assumes the built dependency `build/disk.raw` can be generated by
other rules which are not shown.
