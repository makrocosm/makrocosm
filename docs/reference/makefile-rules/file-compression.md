# File compression

Compress any build artifact.
The compression format is chosen by appending the relevant file suffix to
the uncompressed file's name.

## Compress file with xz

  - Target: `build/${file}.xz`
  - Built dependencies:
    - `build/${file}` - The file to compress.

### Example

The following Makefile rule shows how to define a phony target `build`
that generates the xz-compressed `build/disk.raw.xz` file from the build
artifact `build/disk.raw`.

```make
.PHONY: build
build: build/disk.raw.xz
```

This assumes the built dependency `build/disk.raw` can be generated by
other rules which are not shown.

## Compress file with gzip

  - Target: `build/${file}.gz`
  - Built dependencies:
    - `build/${file}` - The file to compress.
